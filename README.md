# Roblox
Roblox's a free game engine where you can both play community games and make them.
However, roblox's moderation can be strict. Thus it can get you warned, terminated or banned for false reasons.

Steps:

1. Open Roblox Studio. ( Download it here: https://www.roblox.com/create ) ( It must be https://www.roblox.com/, otherwise it may be fake. )
2. Make a new place or use one if you have a workplace already.
3. Insert a new script into ServerScriptService, called AuxGenerator.
  Your code may be represented as this:
  ```lua
  
  ```
